# Master-Microservices-with-Spring-Boot-and-Spring-Cloud---Project
Project referring to the course Java Spring Boot Microservices 5-in-1 - Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes and REST API (REST Web Services)


COURSE OVERVIEW:

Developing RESTful web services and REST API is fun. The combination of Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Services and JPA makes it even more fun. And its even more fun to create Microservices.

There are two parts to this course - RESTful web services and Microservices

Architectures are moving towards microservices. RESTful web services are the first step to developing great microservices. Java and Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services.

In the first part of the course, you will learn the basics of RESTful web services developing resources for a social media application. You will learn to implement these resources with multiple features - versioning, exception handling, documentation (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security), filtering and HATEOAS. You will learn the best practices in designing RESTful web services.

In this part of the course, you will be using Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC (or Spring REST), Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring), Swagger (Documentation), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE), Postman (REST Services Client) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.

In the second part of the course, you will learn the basics of Microservices. You will understand how to implement microservices using Spring Cloud.

In this part of the course, you will learn to establish communication between microservices, enable load balancing, scaling up and down of microservices. You will also learn to centralize the configuration of microservices with Spring Cloud Config Server. You will implement Eureka Naming Server and Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin. You will create fault tolerant microservices with Zipkin.

In the third part of the course, you will learn the basics of Docker. You will understand how to build containers for microservices built using Docker and Spring Cloud.

In the fourth part of the course, you will learn the basics of Kubernetes. You will understand how to orchestrate microservices with Kubernetes.
